            <h4><b>Swyambunath</b></h4>
            <p>Find peace and prayers on the little hillock of Swaymbhunath in the northwest of Kathmandu Valley.
                Visitors for whom the name was a tongue twister have called it "Monkey Temple" from the 1970s.
                Swayambhu, overlooks most parts of the valley giving visitors a panoramic view of the city. The stupa
                has stood as a hallmark of faith and harmony for centuries with Hindu temples and deities incorporated
                in this Buddhist site. The glory of Kathmandu Valley is said to have started from this point.

                Resting on a hillock 3 km west of Kathmandu, Swayambhu is one of the holiest Buddhist stupas in Nepal.
                It is said to have evolved spontaneously when the valley was created out of a primordial lake more than
                2,000 years ago. This stupa is the oldest of its kind in Nepal and has numerous shrines and monasteries
                on its premises. </p>
